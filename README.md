# Multiomics_data-for-prediction-gestational_age

Gestational age is a method of studying the patterns of fetal growth and development over time-based on gestational age at birth. Gestational age is the number of weeks that have passed since the first day of the last menstrual period. It is an essential indicator of fetal maturity and health outcomes. In this repository, we collect datasets and train them based on information from the paper as title 'Multiomics modeling of the immunome, transcriptome, microbiome, proteome, and metabolome adaptations during human pregnancy'.
